          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer with 4 years of experience in
            building web and mobile applications. I focus on developing
            efficient, scalable solutions, and I‚Äôve worked on both front-end and
            back-end systems. I‚Äôm skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript, and AWS,
            and I‚Äôve used frameworks like React.js and Node.js, along with
            databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve worked across a range of industries, including logistics,
            telecommunications, and education. Most recently, I developed a
            transportation management system at CURA Freight, and before that, I
            led software projects at Mobicom and Bytelinks. I‚Äôve also just
            completed my Master of Science in Computer Science, which has given
            me a deeper understanding of software architecture and cloud
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving complex problems and building innovative
            applications that have a real-world impact. I‚Äôm always looking for
            new challenges where I can contribute and continue to grow as a
            developer.
